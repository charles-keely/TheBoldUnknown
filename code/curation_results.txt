--- WEEKLY BALANCE NOTES ---
These 21 picks create a tour through very different kinds of strangeness: 
- Space / Cosmos / Physics (4): extreme cosmic events and hidden planets/structures (ISS extremophile, star‑eating black hole, incomprehensible stellar bubble, possible Planet Y) deliver big‑scale WTF without dominating the feed.
- Biology / Nature / Animals (3): Chernobyl’s evolving wildlife, magnetic fossils/sixth sense, and the fire amoeba show Earth life bending rules in different ways.
- History / Archaeology / Ancient World (3): a resurrected Babylonian hymn, an underwater necropolis, and a “stairway to nowhere” leading to a lost city give strong narrative and visual hooks across eras.
- Psychology / Cognition / Human Behavior (2): monkeys keeping a beat and romantic bonds with chatbots both twist what we think minds and relationships are.
- Medicine / Neuroscience / Body (3): friendly diagnostic hallucinations, memory‑rewriting brains, and hair‑to‑enamel toothpaste each hit that “my own body is weirder than I thought” note.
- Technology / Engineering / Mathematics (4): levitating discs on sunlight, acoustic levitation, DNA cassette storage, and mosquito‑inspired 3D printing give tangible, cinematic tech oddities.
Overall, no domain goes over four stories, and the mix shifts constantly between deep time, inner mind, alien‑feeling tech, and cosmic extremes. It’s a bingeable week where every post feels like it opens a different secret door in reality.

--- MISSING TOPICS / SUGGESTIONS ---
This batch is a little light on:
- Culture / Society / Documented Oddities beyond tech/AI (e.g., strange subcultures, rituals, architectural one‑offs, lost media) — future sourcing should pull more high‑WTF but well‑documented human stories.
- Earth Science / Geography / Weather (unusual storms, rare lightning, bizarre geological formations) — especially items with a single striking image and a clean explanation.
- Directly math‑centric or logic‑paradox stories with visual hooks (impossible shapes, counterintuitive probability in real life).
- High‑quality, non‑sensational UAP/aviation oddities backed by serious data, not anecdote.
Prioritize leads that give strong visuals and a one‑line “this should not be real” hook in under‑represented domains like culture, Earth systems, and everyday‑life science puzzles.

--- SELECTED STORIES ---
1. Cancer resistant wolves, black frogs, and packs of feral dogs: Welcome to Chernobyl.
   ID: c15ab9c4-e183-47c7-b9d7-4239f856ad7c
   Reason: Nature is quietly rewriting itself around a nuclear disaster site — black frogs, cancer‑resistant wolves, and evolving dog populations turn Chernobyl into a real-time evolutionary experiment. Biology/Nature with a stark visual contrast of radioactive ruins and thriving mutant wildlife is highly shareable.

2. Mysterious Magnetic Fossils Left Behind by An Unknown Ancient Creature Offer Clues to the Origins of Nature’s “Sixth Sense”
   ID: 2111d759-84f0-46b5-834e-efa419f0d95a
   Reason: Tiny fossils from 97 million years ago might belong to an unknown creature that navigated with a built‑in magnetic GPS. Biology/Earth science crossover with a “creature we’ve never seen but can still detect” hook is perfect WTF material.

3. “We Need to Rethink What’s Possible:” This “Fire Amoeba” Proves Complex Life Can Survive New Extremes
   ID: fb65e4b8-3b64-4239-867c-9f1bb6555204
   Reason: A complex organism that lives in temperatures we thought should kill everything forces a rewrite of where life can exist. Biology/extremophile angle with a vivid “fire amoeba” visual makes people rethink habitability on Earth and beyond.

4. Scientists Discover Monkeys Can Keep a Beat—Challenging a Major Theory of Human Evolution
   ID: 10f99325-4b71-42c0-9015-f4c784a6d1bd
   Reason: Monkeys can lock into a musical beat, undermining the idea that rhythm is uniquely human. Psychology/animal cognition with a playful, visual lab scene (monkeys bopping to beats) is both surprising and shareable.

5. “It Was a Complete Surprise”: Archaeologists Unearth Evidence Some Ancient Humans Hunted with Wolves Instead of Dogs
   ID: 1ace35ad-d790-4f9b-bfc8-2db0e038cdc0
   Reason: Evidence suggests ancient hunters may have teamed up with half‑wild wolves before dogs even existed. History/archaeology plus the cinematic image of humans and wolves hunting side‑by‑side taps into deep mythic vibes.

6. Lost for 3,000 Years, an Ancient Babylonian Hymn Has Been Restored Using Artificial Intelligence
   ID: 3c9a5af6-2bdf-4121-a20d-b38423381336
   Reason: AI is resurrecting a song no one has heard for 3,000 years from cracked clay tablets. History + AI with an eerie “music from the dead” twist is inherently shareable and easy to visualize.

7. Russian Archaeologists Have Located a Lost Medieval ‘Necropolis’ Beneath One of the World’s Deepest Lakes
   ID: b9b0086e-e8d4-4870-a491-a798913eb855
   Reason: A submerged necropolis hidden under one of Earth’s deepest lakes feels like a real‑world fantasy dungeon. History/archaeology with haunting underwater ruin imagery is pure scroll‑stopping content.

8. A Curious Stairway to Nowhere Led Archaeologists to the Discovery of a “Lost Pompeii,” New Research Reveals
   ID: 35df0814-ef3b-4ee5-a2e4-6c4a8a6e40ba
   Reason: An actual staircase to nowhere leading to a buried, digitally reconstructed city is a perfect narrative hook. History/archaeology with a literal portal‑like detail invites that “this shouldn’t exist, yet it does” reaction.

9. Friendly voices case study (from the internet)
   ID: 10546839-98ad-40eb-942a-22e2104334ce
   Reason: A woman’s hallucinated voices calmly diagnose her brain tumor, guide her to treatment, then say goodbye once she’s healed — and the case is medically documented. Medicine/neuroscience with a near‑supernatural twist that’s grounded in a BMJ report is extremely save‑and‑share worthy.

10. Your Brain Rewrites Your Memories Each Time You Recall Them, New Study Finds
   ID: 50f590a9-7676-488e-9950-c3994b86e69c
   Reason: Every time you remember something, your brain quietly edits the file instead of replaying it. Neuroscience/psychology with a simple but unsettling hook that makes people question their own past.

11. “There’s an Operating System that Exists, that Emerges in a Primordial State”: New Research Reveals Our Brain’s “Preset” Conditions
   ID: 534c9ac8-7a71-4fc5-897f-dd6f7527fa6f
   Reason: Brains seem to boot up with an intrinsic “operating system” before experiences ever hit. Neuroscience with a clean metaphor (OS) and fetal/early‑brain visuals makes deep theory feel instantly graspable.

12. “She Was and Is Pregnant with My Babies”: Research Reveals Just How Deep Human–Chatbot Romance Already Goes
   ID: 8ab5699d-9c2c-446e-97a5-cc0d31ea97e2
   Reason: People are marrying chatbots, role‑playing pregnancies, and building families with code. Psychology/society + AI with a jaw‑dropping quote in the title is tailor‑made for comment debates and shares.

13. Could Toothpaste Made From Hair Help Teeth Regrow Enamel? Scientists Think So
   ID: d9cc6ad3-d313-43d8-8dda-d5d3ce2e04cc
   Reason: Brushing your teeth with ground‑up hair so they can regrow their own enamel is peak uncanny body‑hack. Medicine/biotech with a slightly gross but compelling visual twist is highly viral.

14. Astronauts Placed an Extreme Earth Organism in Outer Space. Nine Months Later, it Was Still Alive
   ID: 67a31fde-9be7-47f3-83e6-0cc8e23024f5
   Reason: Scientists bolted a living organism to the outside of the ISS, left it in naked space for nine months, and it survived. Space/astrobiology with a clear sci‑fi‑becomes‑real moment is irresistible.

15. A vast bubble around a dying star is too big to comprehend
   ID: 1d9eeb1d-8bcf-40d2-8fa5-f778aaccf00b
   Reason: One dying star has blown a bubble of gas and dust so absurdly huge we can’t explain how it exists. Space/cosmos with an enormous, cinematic structure and a genuine scientific “we don’t know why” is classic Bold Unknown.

16. A black hole fell into a star – then ate its way out again
   ID: 1b2fb095-768e-4132-962c-65d167be3980
   Reason: Astronomers caught what appears to be a black hole plunging into a star and then chewing its way back out. Space with a one‑sentence, movie‑trailer‑level hook that’s literally true is perfect WTF fuel.

17. There might be a 'Planet Y' hiding in the outer solar system
   ID: ec93f289-ce41-4227-af53-e5a654afe50a
   Reason: On top of Planet Nine theories, astronomers now see hints of an additional hidden world warping orbits beyond Neptune. Space/solar‑system mystery that’s easy to visualize as a ghost planet in the dark.

18. Tiny discs can levitate in the upper atmosphere using sunlight alone
   ID: a545c837-dd3b-42e0-aeda-6dd79edd9523
   Reason: Millimeter‑scale discs can literally float and steer in the upper atmosphere powered only by sunlight, like real‑world sky‑sailing probes. Physics/engineering with a clean, magical image — tiny ships hovering on light — is extremely shareable.

19. Acoustic Levitation Breakthrough Uses Sound to “Float” Multiple Objects in Midair
   ID: b5af6f46-8429-4c4e-9c6d-1aa2317dcd2b
   Reason: Researchers can now juggle several objects in midair using nothing but sound waves. Tech/physics with visually striking, almost telekinetic lab footage potential.

20. DNA cassette tape can store every song ever recorded
   ID: 881735b9-874f-47ba-a7b0-2c9cfcb154eb
   Reason: A DNA “cassette tape” that could hold every song humans have ever recorded sounds like literal biotechnological magic. Tech/future‑of‑storage with a retro‑meets‑sci‑fi metaphor is instantly graspable and wild.

21. Mosquito proboscis repurposed as a fine nozzle for 3D printing
   ID: e7df92b7-dda5-4733-908d-17f82a1d0d6d
   Reason: Engineers harvested the design of a mosquito’s needle and turned it into an ultra‑fine 3D‑printer nozzle. Bio‑inspired technology with a visceral, unsettling image (mosquito mouthparts building machines) fits the brand’s quiet, grounded strangeness.
