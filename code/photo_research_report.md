- **Description:** Two researchers wearing protective laser-style safety glasses are closely observing and discussing an experimental setup in a bright laboratory. The person on the left, in a gray sweater, is pointing toward the apparatus, which includes metallic components, cables, and optical or acoustic equipment partly visible in the foreground. The person on the right, in a knit sweater, is leaning in to look at the same device. Computer monitors with code or data are visible in the background, reinforcing the high-tech research environment.

- **Verifiability:** 8/10
- **Description:** A close-up, shallow-depth-of-field photograph of a laboratory setup. At the center, a bright blue light glows between a cylindrical object above (likely a transducer or probe) and a flat surface or plate below, suggesting a gap where microscopic particles or a focal point might be located. The scene is illuminated with blue light reflections on the lower plate and the underside of the upper component. Blurred metal posts, screws, and wires appear in the foreground and background, indicating electrical connections or mounting hardware. The overall impression is of a high-tech physics or engineering experiment involving precise control of particles or fields in a small region of space.

- **Description:** Six-panel black‑and‑white scientific figure showing sequences of small bright spheres levitating between a top cylindrical emitter and a lower flat plate. The panels, labeled (a) through (f), depict different spatial configurations of the particles in midair: in some panels they form a nearly straight vertical column, while in others they appear as a curved, angled, or kinked chain of separated particles extending from the region below the top transducer toward the lower reflector plate. The background is dark, emphasizing the white particles and hardware of the levitation apparatus.
