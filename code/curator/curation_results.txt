Candidate Pool Size: 108
Model: gpt-5.1

--- WEEKLY BALANCE NOTES ---
The 21 picks span: Space/Cosmos/Physics (4: extremophile in space, star bubble, black hole eating its way out, sunlight-levitated discs), Biology/Nature/Animals (3: Chernobyl wildlife, wolves-as-partners in prehistory, shark seamounts), Psychology/Neuroscience/Human Behavior (4: friendly diagnostic voices, brain OS, memory rewriting, widespread consciousness), Technology/Engineering/Mathematics (5: sound levitation breakthrough, acoustic ‘invisible grabber’ chip, DNA cassette storage, mosquito-inspired 3D nozzle, lunar-soil life-support device), Medicine/Body (1: hair-toothpaste regrowing enamel), History/Archaeology/Ancient World (2: AI-restored Babylonian hymn, ancient wolf-hunters), Culture/Society/Documented Oddities (2: mysterious song, Fairy Investigation Society), plus a Culture/AI crossover (chatbot romance). No single domain exceeds 5 stories, and the mix alternates between cosmic scale, intimate brain/body oddities, ancient-history twists, and deeply modern AI-weirdness, creating a bingeable sense of touring very different kinds of strangeness.

--- MISSING TOPICS / SUGGESTIONS ---
This pool was thinner on Earth/atmospheric phenomena (e.g., sprites, strange lightning), pure geology/weird landscapes, and high-strangeness but well-documented cryptids or anomalous animals. Future sourcing should prioritize: (1) visually striking Earth and weather oddities with hard science behind them; (2) deeply evidenced but little-known archaeological sites and artifacts with a ‘this shouldn’t exist yet’ vibe; (3) well-documented animal cognition and communication breakthroughs (whales, octopi, corvids, etc.) that feel almost supernatural; and (4) grounded, non-sensational UFO/UAP or aerospace anomalies with strong primary documentation and visuals.

--- SELECTED STORIES ---

7. Moving Objects without Touching Them: Scientists Invent Chip that Generates Acoustic Waves as “Invisible Grabbers”
   ID: 39ca4213-8d8a-4d6f-b930-f2254260dd8d
   Reason: A tiny chip that lets you grab and move things without touching them sounds like a sci‑fi gadget. Tech/Engineering that pairs well visually with slow‑motion levitation shots and everyday objects.

8. DNA cassette tape can store every song ever recorded
   ID: 881735b9-874f-47ba-a7b0-2c9cfcb154eb
   Reason: The phrase “every song ever recorded on a strand of DNA” is a killer hook. Tech/Math with a retro‑meets‑biotech visual (cassette + double helix) that feels impossible yet true.

9. Mosquito proboscis repurposed as a fine nozzle for 3D printing
   ID: e7df92b7-dda5-4733-908d-17f82a1d0d6d
   Reason: Engineers ripping the needle‑mouth off a mosquito to build ultra‑fine 3D printers is deliciously unsettling. Bio‑inspired Engineering with a strong “who thought of this?” share factor.

10. Simple device can produce water, oxygen and fuel from lunar soil
   ID: 58c44396-0bef-4154-876f-4b72f1d9527c
   Reason: Turning dead lunar dust into water, air, and rocket fuel is alchemy‑level weirdness. Space/Engineering with clear visuals of astronauts feeding gray soil into a box that outputs life support.

   ID: 534c9ac8-7a71-4fc5-897f-dd6f7527fa6f
   Reason: The idea that your brain boots up with a hidden ‘operating system’ before any experience reframes consciousness in a single sentence. Neuroscience with a strong conceptual WTF that’s easy to share.

14. Your Brain Rewrites Your Memories Each Time You Recall Them, New Study Finds
   ID: 50f590a9-7676-488e-9950-c3994b86e69c
