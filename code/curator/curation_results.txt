--- WEEKLY BALANCE NOTES ---
These 21 stories create a tour through very different kinds of strangeness while avoiding overloading any single domain. Biology/Nature/Animals (4): Chernobyl wildlife hacking radiation, a ‘fire amoeba’ surviving impossible heat, unknown magnetic-fossil creatures with a sixth sense, and a tiny worm revealing brain–aging controls. Human origins & archaeology (4): half‑million‑year-old carpentry, Neolithic blueprint engravings, a 12,000‑year-old fired figurine showing early pyrotechnology, and a 3.4‑million‑year-old footprint from a mysterious hominin. Space / Cosmos / Physics (4): a Milky Way twin that shouldn’t exist, a record‑long gamma‑ray burst, possible first direct dark matter evidence, and a supernova that may have literally ‘hit’ Earth. Mind / Neuroscience / Psychology (4): brains with a built‑in operating system, memories being rewritten on recall, psychedelic compounds reshaping addiction circuits, and hidden awareness in vegetative states. Tech / Engineering / Materials (5): DNA as a cassette for every song ever recorded, a sound‑based ‘invisible grabber’ chip, sunlight‑levitating discs in the upper atmosphere, a Moon‑soil device making water/oxygen/fuel, and advanced acoustic/levitation‑adjacent tech via the chip. Overall, the week flows from life in extreme places (Chernobyl, fire amoeba, deep history) to cosmic anomalies, to the unsettling plasticity of mind and memory, and finally to quietly wild technologies that make the near future feel uncanny but tangible.

--- MISSING TOPICS / SUGGESTIONS ---
This batch is light on overt culture/society oddities (urban legends, rituals, strange festivals), Earth‑surface geo/weird weather stories, and grounded ‘documented oddities’ like lost media or unexplained historical events. For future sourcing, prioritize: (1) high‑quality, well‑documented cultural mysteries (vanished songs, lost films, bizarre but real organizations); (2) extreme Earth phenomena (unusual storms, lakes, caves, geological structures that behave in impossible ways); (3) unsettling but evidence‑based UAP/USO cases and military tech curiosities; and (4) more stories where everyday systems hide something bizarre (unexpected uses of casinos, infrastructures behaving strangely, hidden tunnels, underworlds beneath cities).

--- SELECTED STORIES ---

   ID: 61e3090e-7c59-4165-ab93-5b2d46a77cad
   Reason: Stone-age hunters carving to-scale blueprints for giant animal traps is a perfect ‘they were way more advanced than we think’ twist with great diagram-style visuals.

8. 12,000-Year-Old Figurine Shows Humans Used “Pyrotechnology” Thousands of Years Before the First Societies
   ID: 14765819-5066-479d-9cff-af1228075022
   Reason: A tiny ancient figurine quietly proves humans were mastering controlled high-heat tech long before civilization, flipping timelines in one object.

9. This 3.4-Million-Year-Old Foot Reveals Another Mysterious Early Human Species Once Walked in the Same Area as Our Ancestors
   ID: 8105c562-2917-442a-802b-81a1ce73137f
   Reason: A single fossilized footprint revealing that two different human species shared the same landscape makes deep time feel immediate and uncanny.
